## Control the Center

The center of the board (d4, d5, e4, e5) is strategically important because:

1. Pieces control more squares from central positions
2. Pieces can move more easily to either side of the board
3. Control of the center provides more space and mobility

**Key Principle:** Aim to control the center with pawns and pieces.

In the position shown, White has moved 1.e4, taking the first step toward controlling the center.
